          <iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQQpHKC7uJM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>This window displays the location of all aircraft and equipment scheduled on the hangar floor at a given time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>On the left side of the window, a 3D render of the hangar at the selected time is displayed.
            <li>On the right side of the window, all aircraft and equipment scheduled to be placed are displayed along with their corresponding controls.
            <li>Underneath the 3D render is a control panel for changing the displayed time as well as a save button to store changed information to the database.
          </ul>
          <p>3D Render</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The 3D render portion of the window can be controlled by both mouse and touchscreen interfaces.</li>
            <li>To pan around the render, either left click and drag the mouse or swipe the touchscreen in the desired vector of motion.</li>
            <li>To zoom in on an area of the 3D render, either use the mouse scroll wheel or a pinching action on the touchscreen.</li>
            <li>To move the center point of the render, right click and drag the mouse.</li>
            <li>Aircraft and equipment can be repositioned by either left clicking and dragging with the mouse or selecting and dragging with a touchscreen.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Aircraft and Equipment Controls</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each piece of aircraft and equipment added in the schedule will appear in this section.</li>
            <li>If the aircraft or equipment has not yet been added to the hangar, the corresponding controls will consist of a “+” symbol.</li>
            <li>Clicking the “+” symbol will add a 3D model of the aircraft or equipment to the 3D render.</li>
            <li>Once an aircraft or equipment has been added, more tools will become available and the control section will highlight when an aircraft or equipment is moused over in the 3D render.</li>
            <li>The tools that will become available upon adding an aircraft or equipment allow to rotate the 3D model in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction as well as an option to remove the 3D model from the 3D render.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Time and Save Controls</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are two primary ways of changing the time displayed on the 3D render.</li>
            <li>There is a slider bar immediately under the 3D render window that allows the user to select the time on the currently selected date.</li>
            <li>If the screen size of the viewing device is too small for exact positioning of this slider bar, it will be replaced by drop down menus allowing for exact time selection.</li>
            <li>Below the slider bar is the Save button. This button stores the location for all aircraft and equipment to the server.</li>
            <li>If the Save button is not clicked before leaving the window or changing times, no positional information will be stored to the server.</li>
            <li>The Save button is flanked by buttons to jump the 3D render window to either the previous or next days.</li>
            <li>All the positions that were changed has an effect on the relevant aircraft and equipment until the time that they are scheduled to leave that hangar space.</li>
